## Weapon Wheel!

-Description: A fun, new, and social way for lovers of Fantasy to connect.

“Weapon Wheel” will comprise of a library of folkloric weaponry, both fictional and non-fictional

and provide a way to store these choices on a clickable link in the shape of a wheel (which will be able to be customized).

Hovering over each image (provided by user or DB) will offer a brief description and to what works of art both past and present

that they have been tied to. This information will be stored in the DB originally, but once I come up with a proper vetting process

I will allow users to post anything that is missed
